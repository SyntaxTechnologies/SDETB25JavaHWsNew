         * 1. Declare and Initialize Your 2D Array:
         *    - Think of your 2D array as a table with rows and columns.
         *    - For example, you might have a 2D array like:
         *      {
         *         {1, 2, 3, 4},
         *         {5, 6, 7, 8},
         *         {9, 10, 11, 12}
         *      }
         *
         * 2. Use Nested Loops to Traverse the Array:
         *    - The outer loop will go through each row.
         *    - The inner loop will go through each element in the current row.
         *
         * 3. Print Each Element:
         *    - Inside the inner loop, use System.out.print() to print the current element followed by a space.
         *    - After finishing each row (i.e., after the inner loop), use System.out.println() to move to the next line.
