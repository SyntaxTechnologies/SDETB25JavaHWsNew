         * Objective: Extract and print test durations that exceed a given threshold.
         *
         * Steps to follow:
         * 1. Declare and initialize an array of integers with test durations.
         *    - Example: Think of the array as a list of test run times (e.g., {45, 82, 63, 95, 50, 70, 110, 55, 60}).
         *
         * 2. Set a threshold value for a slow test.
         *    - Hint: Tests that run longer than 70 seconds are considered slow.
         *
         * 3. Use an enhanced for loop to go through each element in the array.
         *    - For each test duration, check if it is greater than the threshold using an if statement.
         *    - If the condition is met, print that duration.
