# Print Years using Enhanced For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to create and use 1D arrays in Java to store and print a series of years using an enhanced for loop. In this exercise, you'll also learn to fill an array with values using a loop.

## Instructions

**Print Years Using an Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that:
1. Declares an array of integers with enough space to hold the years from 2025 to 2035.
2. Uses a `normal for` loop to fill the array with the years from 2025 to 2035.
3. Uses an enhanced `for` loop (for-each loop) to iterate through the array and print each year on a new line.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
   - Create an array of integers with a size of 11 (to store the years 2025 through 2035).

2. **Fill the Array with Years Using a For Loop**
   - Use a standard `for` loop to add the years 2025 to 2035 into the array.

3. **Print the Array Values Using an Enhanced For Loop**
   - Use an enhanced `for` loop to iterate through the array and print each value on a new line.

## Expected Output
```
2025
2026
2027
2028
2029
2030
2031
2032
2033
2034
2035
```

## Tips
- Make sure your `for` loop is set up correctly to fill the array without going out of bounds.
- Use the enhanced for loop to simplify the process of printing each element from the array.
- Remember: an enhanced for loop is a convenient way to iterate over arrays or collections without needing to manage an index manually.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: A container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **For Loop**: A control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code a set number of times.
- **Enhanced For Loop**: A simpler way to traverse arrays or collections, automatically iterating over each element.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors like missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that your loop conditions and array indices are correct.

By following these steps, you'll build a strong foundation in using arrays and loops in Java. Happy coding!
