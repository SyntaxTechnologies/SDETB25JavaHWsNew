         * 1. In your Student class, declare three instance variables:
         *    - int year;
         *    - String schoolName;
         *    - int batchNumber;
         *
         * 2. In your main method, create two objects of the Student class.
         *
         * 3. For the first object, assign:
         *      - year = 2050
         *      - schoolName = "Syntax"
         *      - batchNumber = 200
         *
         * 4. For the second object, assign:
         *      - year = 2051
         *      - schoolName = "Tech"
         *      - batchNumber = 300
         *
         * 5. Use System.out.println to print the details for each student in the following format:
         *      "I am a student of batch [batchNumber] studying at [schoolName] in the year of [year]."
         *
         * 6. Ensure you print the details for both objects.
