         * Heads Up This is a little bit tricky
         * 1. Create an ArrayList or LinkedList of Integer.
         * 2. Filter the list to remove ages not between 25 and 60:
         *    - Use ages.removeIf(age -> age < 25 || age > 60);
         *
         * 3. Sort the list:
         *    - Use Collections.sort(ages);
         *
         * 4. Calculate the average:
         *    - Initialize a sum variable to 0.
         *    - Loop through the list to add up all ages.
         *    - Compute the average as sum divided by the number of elements.
         *
         * 5. Print the results:
         *    - Print the sorted list of remaining ages.
         *    - Print the average age.
         *
         * Expected output should be:
         * Remaining ages: [30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60]
         * Average age: 45.0
