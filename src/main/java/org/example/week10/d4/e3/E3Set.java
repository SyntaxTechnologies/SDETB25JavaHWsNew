        // Initialize a LinkedHashSet<String> to store email addresses, which will preserve the order in which they were added and ensure that duplicates are not stored.
        // Step 2: Add the following email addresses to the LinkedHashSet:
        // Add null, "john.doe@example.com", "jane.smith@example.com", "john.doe@example.com" (duplicate), "admin@event.com", and "info@company.com".
        // Step 3: Use a for-each loop to iterate through the LinkedHashSet and print the email addresses one by one.
