        // Step 2: Add the following product details to the LinkedHashMap:
        // Add "Laptop" = 1200.99, "Smartphone" = 799.99, "Tablet" = 499.99, "Smartwatch" = 199.99, "Headphones" = 149.99.
        // Step 3: Use a for-each loop to iterate through the entries of the LinkedHashMap and print both the product name and price one by one.
