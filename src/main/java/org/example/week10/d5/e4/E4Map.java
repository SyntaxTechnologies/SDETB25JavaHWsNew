        // Step 2: Add the following student records to the HashMap:
        // Add `101 = "John"`, `102 = "Emily"`, `103 = "Michael"`, `104 = "Sarah"`, `105 = "David"`.
        // Step 3: Use the `keySet()` method to retrieve all the keys (student IDs) from the HashMap.
        // Use a loop to iterate through the keys of the HashMap and print each student ID in the format:"Student ID: [key]".
        // Step 4: Use the `values()` method to retrieve all the values (student names) from the HashMap.
        // Use a loop to iterate through the values of the HashMap and print each student name in the format:"Student Name: [value]".
        // Step 5: Use the `entrySet()` method** to retrieve both keys and values as `Map.Entry` objects from the HashMap.
        // Use a loop to iterate through both keys and values of the HashMap and print each student ID and name in the format:"Student ID: [key], Student Name: [value]".
